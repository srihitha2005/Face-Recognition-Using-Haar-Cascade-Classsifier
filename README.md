# Face-Recognition-Using-Haar-Cascade-Classsifier
This project implements real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar cascades. It captures video from a webcam and detects faces in each frame.

## Features
1. Uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascade classifier.
2. Converts frames to grayscale for better detection.
3. Draws rectangles around detected faces.
4. Displays live video feed with detected faces.
5. Press q to exit the detection window.
